# ERC-4907 Profit-Share Extension

## Abstract

Orium's ERC-4907 Profit-Share is an extension of the [ERC-4907](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4907.md)
standard. It proposes to store two additional arrays (`beneficiaries` and `split`) to enable developers to distribute
rewards across multiple beneficiaries.

## Motivation

In early 2022, a new ethereum improvement proposal was introduced that added a new role to the ERC-721 standard.
ERC-4907 included the `user` role to enable NFT owners to assign another address that can use a specific NFT. As more
and more projects implement this standard, Orium developed a simple extension that expands this scope to support
profit-share-based rentals.

## Specification

The interface below lists all new events and functions included in this extension. Note that every ERC-4907
Profit-Share compliant contract must implement the ERC-4907 interface.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

interface ERC4907ProfitShare is ERC4907 {

    struct ProfitShareInfo {
        address[] beneficiaries;
        uint256[] split;
    }

    /** Events **/

    /// @notice Emits when the beneficiaries or rewards split is updated
    /// @dev The zero address for user indicates that there is no user address
    event UpdateProfitShare(uint256 indexed tokenId, address[] beneficiaries, uint256[] split);

    /** Functions **/

    /// @notice Set the user and beneficiaries of an NFT
    /// @param tokenId The tokenId of the NFT
    /// @param user The address of the NFT user
    /// @param expires The time when the user access expires in UNIX timestamp
    /// @param beneficiaries The recipients of the rewards
    /// @param split The share of the rewards that each beneficiary receives
    function setUserProfitShare(uint256 tokenId, address user, uint64 expires, address[] memory beneficiaries, uint256[] memory split) public;

    /// @notice Get the splits of an NFT renting
    /// @dev The zero value indicates that there is no user
    /// @param tokenId The NFT to get the beneficiaries for
    function splitOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256[] memory);

    /// @notice Get the beneficiaries of an NFT reting
    /// @dev The zero value indicates that there is no user
    /// @param tokenId The NFT to get the beneficiaries for
    function beneficiariesOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address[] memory);
    
    // @notice Get the amount of tokens to distribute to each beneficiary
    // @param tokenId The tokenId of the NFT
    // @param amount The amount of tokens to be splitted
    function splitTokensFor(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) view returns (uint256[] memory);
    
}
```

### Monitoring User Rights & Profit-Share Assignment

In order to find out which user holds access rights for an NFT, and whom are the beneficiaries, developers can either:

- Call view functions to return the desired information. `userOf(uint256 tokenId)` should return the user address, and
  `beneficiariesOf(uint256 tokenId)` and `splitOf(uint256 tokenId)` should return the reward recipients.
- Build a database to monitor the events `UpdateUser` and `UpdateProfitShare`. Each time these events are emitted, the
  database must be updated with the new values and the expiration date.

### Caveats

- One can check if a contract implements `IERC4907ProfitShare` with ERC-165 `supportsInterface`.
- Since no event will be emitted when the user rights expires, it's important to build logic to automatically expire
  users and beneficiaries at the expiration date.
- The event `UpdateProfitShare` contains two arrays: `beneficiaries` and `split`. Each beneficiary is entitled to a 
  share of the tokens earned, defined by the value of `split`. 100% of the total tokens is equal to 100 ether, 
  meaning that 10% is 10e18, 5% is 5e18 and so on. The sum of all the items of the `split` array should always be
  100 ether (or 100%).
- To calculate how many tokens should be transferred to each beneficiary, `splitTokensFor` should be used. It will split the
  amount of tokens between the `beneficiaries` at the rate stored at `split`.
